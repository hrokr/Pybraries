# Iranian Census Data

I find Iran fascinating. It has a lot of history and culture.

 But, more to the point, there is a small data set at the [Iran Data Portal](https://irandataportal.syr.edu/about-us) which has decennial census population data for each of the 31 provinces (or Ostans) between 1976 and 2006, but also there is a 2011. Strangely, there isn't anything for 2016. But you get what you get.

 Still, it's a small dataset to work with and since I want to do add in a choropleth, I'll get the bonus task of using mapbox as Iran isn't one of the few standard maps.
