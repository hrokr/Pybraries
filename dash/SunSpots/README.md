# SunSpots

I'm not sure what made me seize on this idea at midnight tonight but we've been looking at the sun for over 300 years. And we have daily observations since about March of 1818. So about 200 years of daily observations.  With the exception of nuclear power, all of our energy comes from the sun. And we are utterly dependent on it. So, watching the sun to see if you could divine the weather, crop yields, or hazards to satellites makes perfect sense. Yet, that's like a 20 year career of 10 individuals; back to back to back.  That's crazy in a world where people yell at their microwave to hurry up because 60 seconds it apparently a feat of patience. 

So, let's see what we see.
