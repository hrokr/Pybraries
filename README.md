# Pybraries == Python Libraries

There are tons of Python Libraries. So many that one can't keep up. That's part of the whole 'batteries included' thing Python. But some libraries are so interesting they're worth exploring in depth. Others are so important, some real degree of fluency is needed. Others are worth just noting a bit.

A quick note: As I get to a point where I think it's either at the end or a suitiable point, I tend to move the code to [little-pyprojects](https://github.com/hrokr/little-pyprojects)

So, I keep some of those here. Here's a few I've found intresting:

<u>Display libraries</u>:
 * folium - wrapper library for, and built on top of, LeafletJS
 * plotly
   - plotly express
   - dash - dashboards using a RESTful MVC with a built-in flask server


<u>Data libraries</u>
 * pygrib - manipulates metorological standard file format
 * pycaret - low-code ML library. As of July 2021, it's a bit rough.

<u>NLP libraries</u>
 * textblob - proccessing text for NLP tasks
