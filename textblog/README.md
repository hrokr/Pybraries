**TextBlob** is a python library for processing text for NLP tasks.

I've done a bit with NLP before while at Galvanize though I can't say it was a success though. On the other hand if you have to have success, it isn't science but more akin to engineering or merely following a set of cookbook instructions.

Speaking of cookbook, that's what I intend to do for this. In part because there are several new parts for me here (Twitter, TextBlog, and -- what got me interested in this is the first place -- pipelining). So I'm following a blog post -- [building an ETL pipeline in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/building-an-etl-pipeline-in-python-f96845089635) for a first iteration.
